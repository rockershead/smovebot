# smovebot

This is a simple chatbot but the queries are restricted. This application is made to help Smove staff monitor the status of cars around Singapore. If you have downloaded my application, you can see that there is a blank line and 3 buttons. The blank line is to input any address in Singapore to obtain the status of cars within 5km radius of the particular address.

The first button is used to obtain the results of the inputted text.Plus the result is voiced out by the using android tts(text-to-speech) capability.

The second button gives the status of cars in the whole island of Singapore.

The last button gives you a visualisation of all the cars in the country by displaying the map. 

Please play with application and have fun!

Thank you.
